# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Simple **python** game created by me to test out the **stddraw** module.
## What it can do so far
There is a multi player and computer mode.
Computer mode chooses random moves and plays it on the board.
## What I would like it to do
I would like to implement an algorithm to check for the best move to play in Tic-Tac-Toe instead of choosing random moves
